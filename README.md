#### 1. Predicting High Priority Tickets: To predict priority 1 & 2 tickets, so
that they can take preventive measures or fix the problem before
it surfaces.
#### 2. Forecast the incident volume in different fields , quarterly and
annual. So that they can be better prepared with resources and
technology planning.
#### 3. Auto tag the tickets with right priorities and right departments so
that reassigning and related delay can be reduced.
#### 4. Predict RFC (Request for change) and possible failure /
misconfiguration of ITSM assets.
